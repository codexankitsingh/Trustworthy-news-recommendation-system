News Recommendation Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes user behavior and news article data to explore category diversity in user interactions over time. The Jupyter Notebook (k.ipynb) processes news articles and user behavior datasets, visualizes the distribution of news categories, and tracks the average number of unique categories users engage with daily.

Purpose

The primary objectives of this project are:





Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and preprocess news articles and user behavior data from tab-separated value (TSV) files.



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the distribution of news categories to understand the dataset's composition.



Temporal Analysis: Analyze how the diversity of news categories (unique categories clicked per user) evolves over time.

Dataset

The analysis relies on two TSV files:





news.tsv: Contains news article details with the following columns:





news_id: Unique identifier for the article.



category: Broad category (e.g., lifestyle, news, health).



subcategory: Specific subcategory (e.g., lifestyleroyals, newsworld).



title: Article title.



abstract: Brief summary (may contain NaN values).



url: Article URL.



title_entities: Entities extracted from the title.



abstract_entities: Entities extracted from the abstract.



behaviors.tsv: Contains user interaction data with the following columns:





impression_id: Unique identifier for the impression.



user_id: Unique user identifier.



timestamp: Date and time of the interaction.



user_history: Space-separated list of news IDs the user has interacted with.



impressions: List of news IDs shown to the user with click indicators (e.g., N12345-1 for clicked, N12345-0 for not clicked).

Dataset Requirements





Ensure both news.tsv and behaviors.tsv are in the same directory as the notebook.



The files must be tab-separated and follow the structure described above.

Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:





pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.



matplotlib: For plotting visualizations.



seaborn: For enhanced statistical visualizations.

Install the dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

The notebook includes a cell that installs matplotlib, but itâ€™s recommended to install all dependencies in advance.

Code Structure

The Jupyter Notebook (k.ipynb) is organized into several cells:





Data Loading:





Loads news.tsv and behaviors.tsv into pandas DataFrames.



Assigns appropriate column names to both datasets.



Prints the first few rows of each DataFrame to verify the data.



Library Installation:





Installs matplotlib (if not already installed).



Imports matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for visualization.



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):





Creates a bar plot to visualize the frequency of news articles by category using seaborn.barplot.



Note: The notebook includes a FutureWarning due to deprecated seaborn behavior. To resolve, update the code to assign the hue parameter explicitly:

sns.barplot(x=category_counts.index, y=category_counts.values, hue=category_counts.index, palette="viridis", legend=False)



Temporal Category Diversity Analysis:





Reloads behavior data and converts the timestamp column to a datetime format.



Sorts the behavior data by timestamp for chronological analysis.



Maps news IDs to their respective categories using a dictionary.



Tracks unique categories per user per day using a defaultdict.



Computes the average number of unique categories clicked per user daily.



Visualizes the temporal trend of category diversity using a seaborn.lineplot.



Final Note:





A placeholder cell with the text "Ends Thankyou! :)" marks the end of the analysis.

How to Run





Setup Environment:





Ensure Python 3.12 or compatible is installed.



Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn



Prepare Data:





Place news.tsv and behaviors.tsv in the same directory as k.ipynb.



Run the Notebook:





Open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook k.ipynb



Execute the cells sequentially to load data, generate visualizations, and perform the analysis.



Expected Outputs:





Printed DataFrames: The first few rows of news_df and behaviors_df.



Bar Plot: Distribution of news articles by category.



Line Plot: Average number of unique categories clicked per user over time.

Visualizations





Category Distribution Bar Plot:





Displays the count of news articles per category.



Uses the viridis color palette for clarity.



Helps identify dominant categories in the dataset.



Temporal Category Diversity Line Plot:





Shows the average number of unique categories users engage with daily.



X-axis: Dates from the timestamp column.



Y-axis: Average unique categories per user.



Includes a grid and rotated x-axis labels for readability.

Notes





The dataset appears to be a subset of a news recommendation system (e.g., MIND dataset), with timestamps from November 2019.



The abstract column in news.tsv may contain missing values (NaN), which are handled implicitly in the analysis.



The temporal analysis focuses on user history (user_history column) rather than impressions, assuming historical interactions reflect user preferences.



To improve performance on large datasets, consider optimizing the defaultdict loop or using parallel processing.



Update the seaborn bar plot code to avoid the FutureWarning as described above.

Future Improvements





Handle Missing Data: Explicitly address NaN values in the abstract column or invalid news_id mappings.



Enhanced Visualizations: Add interactive plots (e.g., using plotly) or additional metrics (e.g., category diversity per user group).



Statistical Analysis: Compute statistical significance of category diversity trends over time.



Scalability: Optimize for larger datasets by using dask or database queries.



Click Analysis: Incorporate the impressions column to analyze click-through rates per category.
